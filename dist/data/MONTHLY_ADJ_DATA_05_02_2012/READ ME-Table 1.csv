1.        General Considerations,,,,
,This Excel workbook contains all Monthly module data reported to the NTD since January 2002 when the Monthly module was introduced in the National transit Database (NTD).,,,
,,,,
,"***New in CY 2012*** This excel workbook now includes estimated monthly industry totals for agencies with a Small Systems Waive in place.  These agencies no longer report data to the Monthly Ridership module beginning in January 2012.  The workbook provides estimates calculated by presenting the rideship figures reported on the Small Systems Waiver (W-30) forms for the previous Annual Report year divided by 12.  For example, the January 2012 monthly UPT total for Small Systems Waiver Agencies is calculated by taking the total UPT reported by Small Systems Waiver agencies on their 2011 W-30 form and dividing by 12.  Estimated VOMS is presented as the actual VOMS total reported through the W-30 forms. ",,,
,,,,
,"***New in CY 2012*** This excel workbook now includes estimated monthly industry totals for Rural reporters.  These agencies do not report data to the Monthly Ridership module.  The workbook provides estimates beginning in January 2012 calculated by presenting the rideship figures reported on the 2010 Rural General Public Transit Service Form (RU-20) forms divided by 12.  For example, the January 2012 monthly UPT total for Rural Agencies is calculated by taking the total UPT reported by Rerual reporters on their 2010 RU-20 form and dividing by 12.  Estimated VOMS is presented as the actual VOMS total reported through the RU-20 forms. ",,,
,,,,
,"The Monthly module includes a limited set of key indicators reported by transit properties. Data is reported on a monthly basis, by mode and type of service, for a calendar year.",,,
,,,,
,The four data items included are:,,,
,,,,
,1.        Unlinked Passenger Trips ,,,
,2.        Vehicle Revenue Miles,,,
,3.        Vehicle Revenue Hours,,,
,4.        Vehicles Operated in Maximum Service (Peak Vehicles),,,
,,,,
,"These data items are also reported in the Annual module. The definitions are the same for both modules, but in the Annual module the data is reported on a fiscal year basis and is an aggregate of the data for the 12 months comprising each property’s fiscal year. ",,,
,,,,
,Users are encouraged to use the glossary of transit terms located at http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/glossary.htm or the reporting manuals located at http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/ for more detailed information. ,,,
,,,,
,"Monthly data are reported by mode and type of service. Fron 2002 through 2011, there were 16 modes in the NTD.  Beginning in January 2012, NTD monthly ridership data is reported according to revised modal classifications.  Service previously reported as bus (MB) now may be reported as MB, Commuter Bus (CB), or Bus Rapid Transit (RB). Additionally, service previously categorized as Light Rail (LR) now may be reported as LR or Streetcar (SR). Also, beginning in January 2012, the Automated Guideway (AG) and Monorail (MO) modes are now combined to a single Monorail/Automated Guideway (MG) mode. Finally, NTD included a new Hybrid Rail (YR) mode beginning in January 2012.  This mode includes several systems previously categorized as Commuter Rail (CR) or Light Rail (LR).  All NTD Monthly data is reported as one of two types of service: Directly Operated (DO) and Purchased Transportation (PT). Directly Operated service is provided directly by a transit property. Purchased Transportation is service contracted from a third party, typically a private operator.",,,
,,,,
,"This file will be updated periodically by FTA to include data for subsequent months, and to incorporate revisions to prior months in the calendar year that have been made by the transit properties. In some cases, this may include revisions to data from previous years. ",,,
,,,,
2.        Data Limitations,,,,
,Users should use caution when using the data and the following items should be considered:,,,
,,,,
,"·          Data quality and completeness have improved significantly over time. The monthly data collection was introduced as a pilot program in 2002. Over time, most transit properties developed new internal data collection and processing methods to meet the new requirements. These developments, combined with the implementation of more sophisticated validation checks by FTA, have resulted in more complete and accurate data in more recent years. ",,,
,"·          After the close of a month, transit properties have one month to compile and submit data to the NTD. Therefore, there is a 30 days lag from the end of the month to the time the data is submitted. Some data may be missing for the most recent month if a transit agency failed to report data on time. Once the data is submitted, it is subjected to review and analysis for data completeness and reasonableness. Additionally, transit properties may revise their data at any time during the calendar year reporting cycle, which lasts through March 1 of the subsequent year. These changes may be done unilaterally by the transit property, as the transit property collects additional data on its operations, and these changes will be reflected in subsequent release of the monthly data base.",,,
,"·          FTA requires properties to report a 100 percent count of unlinked passenger trips if the data is available and reliable. However, there are many properties that do not have the technology or the means required to perform a 100 percent count. (This is because the reporting of unlinked passenger trips requires an accurate count of the number of transfers made by passengers.) In other cases, the service is too complex to allow a 100 percent count. In these cases, FTA allows reporting based on sampling. In general, FTA does not know what method properties use to determine unlinked trips, i.e., if it is based on sampling or a 100 percent count. ",,,
,"·          Unlike unlinked passenger trips, service supplied data (vehicle revenue miles, vehicle revenue hours and vehicles operated in maximum service) must be reported based on a 100 percent count. ",,,
,"·          A transit agency that directly operates some of its motorbus service and contracts out for the rest of its motorbus service will have two separate lines for motorbus service, one for the directly operated component, and another for the purchased transportation component. The same principle holds true for a transit agency that contracts out its service that was previously directly operated. The service will appear on two different lines, depending on whether it was directly operated or purchased transportation. ",,,
,,,,
3.        Major Data Considerations,,,,
,"·          The largest transit property in the U.S., the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA – NTDID #2008) reports bus and heavy rail unlinked passenger trips based on a sampling method designed to meet a maximum margin of error of 10 percent. Starting in 2005, the authority developed a more reliable and accurate unlinked passenger trips data collection method for heavy rail. This new method revealed that the old method undercounted heavy rail unlinked passenger trips by a significant margin, an average of about 20 percent in each month. This file presents the data as reported, i.e. The period January 2002 – December 2004 includes the data estimated based on the old data collection process, while the period January 2005 to the current month/year presents the data based on the new method. Trend analysis covering timeframes starting before January 2005 may be biased due to the data collection method change. The bias does not affect any data aggregation that does not include NYCTA or modes other than heavy rail.",,,
,·          In 2007 New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA - NTDID #2008) began using MetroCard AFC data to gather 100% counts on its bus (MB) service. NYCTA MetroCard AFC data have been reported to NTD beginning in January 2008. Years 2007 and earlier represent surveyor data. NTD analysts have analyzed NYCTA data based on these two collection methods and has determined that no adjustment factor is necessary.  ,,,
,"·          Starting in 2004, a new property began operating in the New York City area. The MTA Bus Company (NTDID #2188) was created in 2004 to take over the operations of a number of companies that operated under franchises granted by the New York City Department of Transportation. The merging of the companies into the MTA Bus began in January 2005 and was completed in February 2006. The first reported month after the merger was January 2006. The properties merged were:",,,
,,,,
,o         Liberty Lines – NTDID #2117 ,,,
,o         Queens Surface Corporation – NTDID #2136,,,
,o         New York Bus – NTDID #2040,,,
,o         GTJC – NTDID #2147,,,
,,,,
,"·          Starting in January 2008, two properties operating in the San Diego Area (San Diego Trolley - NTDID #9054, and MTS Contract Services – NTDID #9185) were merged into the San Diego Transit System – NTDID #9026. The data for this property will now include light rail (LR) (previously reported by San Diego Trolley), purchased bus and demand response services (previously operated by MTS Contract Services), and bus service provided by San Diego Transit System itself.",,,
,"·         In 2008, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA - NTDID #1001) began using a new, more accurate sampling method to report bus unlinked passenger trips. RIPTA first reported UPT based on this new method in June 2008.  The new method revealed that the agency had been over-reporting bus trips by approximately 10%. The adjusted data set includes bus trips using this new process for the first five months of 2008.  The adjusted data set also includes a 10% reduction in RIPTA bus UPT for all months prior to 2008 to compensate for previous method's inflated trip numbers.",,,
,"·         Beginning in January 2008, Hampton Roads Transit (HRT - NTDID #3083) MB UPT data reflects farebox data.  NTD analysts determined that the previous method (applied for year 2007 and earlier) resulted in inflated UPT levels.  The adjusted data set applies an adjustment factor (0.54) to all months prior to January 2008.",,,
,"·         In January of 2008, the Staten Island Railroad (NTDID #2099) began reporting UPT to NTD using an inflation factor to include unpaid passengers. The adjusted data set applies this infation factor (1.7795) to all months prior to 2008 for consistency.",,,
,·         The Las Vegas Monorail (NTDID #9204) last reported UPT to NTD in May of 2008.  The Adjusted data set includes publicly available UPT trip data collected from the Las Vegas Monorail website www.lvmonorail.com) for June 2008 and later.,,,
,·         In January of 2012 Long Island Bus (NTDID #2007) began reporting to the MR Module as Nassau Inter County Express (NTDID #2206),,,
, ,,,
4.        UPT Data Estimation,,,,
,"The Adjusted data file includes estimates for missing UPT data in 2011 and 2012.  Estimates are calculated based on the mothly modal growth rates from an industry-wide sample of transit agencies.  Each estimated value is provided on the tab ""UPT Estimates."" ",,,
,,,,
5.        Who Reports?,,,,
,"All transit properties that are recipients of Urbanized Area Formula Grants from the Federal Transit Administration are required to report. However, transit properties that operate 9 or fewer vehicles in peak service are eligible to receive a waiver that exempts them from the monthly reporting. ",,,
,,,,
,A number of other transit properties voluntarily report to the NTD so as to benefit their local Urbanized Area in the annual apportionment of Urbanized Area Formula Grants. Voluntary NTD reporters are required to report data to the Monthly NTD Module as a condition of having their report accepted by the NTD.,,,
,,,,
,"In some cases, a number of small transit agencies may file a consolidated report. Data for these small agencies would appear together under a single NTD ID. ",,,
,,,,
,"This data set includes all properties that reported have reported to the Monthly Module since January 2002. It includes properties that are no longer active in the database, and properties that began reporting after January 2002. Properties may become inactive by going out of business, merging with other properties, consolidating multiple reports into a single report, or deciding to discontinue voluntary reporting. ",,,
,,,,
